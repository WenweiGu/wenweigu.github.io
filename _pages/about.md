<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a final year Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Michael R. Lyu](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, in 2021. My research focuses on **reliability engineering in cloud systems and LLM systems** based on observability data, especially performance monitoring metrics. 

Please feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:wwgu21@cse.cuhk.edu.hk) if you are interested in my research topics.
